`isabl_cli` is a command line client and SDK for the Isabl Platform infrastructure.

## 🧬 Isabl Platform

- Isabl is a platform for the integration, management, and processing of individual-centric multimodal data. Welcome to the Isabl Documentation!

- Isabl is a plug-and-play data science framework designed to support the processing of multimodal patient-centric data. Have questions? Ask here.

- Isabl has been developed by the [Elli Papaemmanuil's Lab](https://papaemmelab.org) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski), and it's currently used by multiple scientific groups and contributors.

## Installation

```bash
pip install isabl_cli
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for running integration tests)
- Git (for cloning the API repository during tests)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/papaemmelab/isabl_cli.git
   cd isabl_cli
   ```

2. Install the package in editable mode with test dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[test]
   ```

   This installs the package in development mode along with all testing dependencies (pytest, coverage, black, etc.).

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   isabl --help
   ```

## Testing

The test suite can be run in two ways:

### Running Tests via Script (Recommended)

The test script (`./tests/test-with-compose.sh`) automatically clones the `isabl_api` repository, starts the API and database through Docker containers, then executes the test suite using pytest with coverage reporting.

Run the full test suite:

```bash
./tests/test-with-compose.sh
```

To skip the build step (faster for subsequent runs):

```bash
./tests/test-with-compose.sh --skip-build
```

**Note**: The test script requires the API to be running. It will clone the `isabl_api` repository into a sibling `api` directory if it doesn't exist.

### Running Tests Directly

If you have a local Isabl API instance running (e.g., via `docker compose up -d` in the `isabl_api` repository), you can run pytest commands directly:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export ISABL_CLIENT_ID=test-cli-client
export ISABL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=isabl_cli tests/
```

This allows for faster iteration during development without rebuilding containers.

### Running Specific Tests

You can run specific test files or test functions:

```bash
# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/test_api.py::test_function_name

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

## Usage

```bash
# Set up your environment variables
export ISABL_API_URL="http://<your-isabl-instance>/api/v1/"
export CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"

# Authenticate and cache credentials
isabl login

# See all available commands
isabl --help
```

## CI/CD Setup

The GitHub Actions workflow requires the following secrets to be configured in the repository settings:

### Required Secrets

- **`GH_PAT`**: GitHub Personal Access Token for authenticating with GitHub (used to clone the `isabl_api` repository during tests)
- **`DOCKER_USERNAME`**: Docker Hub username for the [papaemmelab organization](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/papaemmelab/repositories)
- **`DOCKER_PASSWORD`**: Docker Hub password or access token for the [papaemmelab organization](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/papaemmelab/repositories)
- **`CODECOV_TOKEN`**: Codecov token for the [papaemmelab/isabl_cli repository](https://app.codecov.io/gh/papaemmelab/isabl_cli)

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
